# Impact-of-Large-Language-Model-on-the-Cognitive-Process
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence over the past three years.  Humans interact with LLMs mainly in two ways: through conversational agents such as ChatGPT, and   through streaming agents such as GitHub Copilot.
With a conversational agent, users engage in dialogue much like they would with another human being. 

In contrast, a streaming agent provides suggestions in real time as one types—an interaction that is 

more direct and intrusive.


These two modes of interaction may influence human cognitive processes in different ways. We tend 

to treat conversational agents as if they were reputable human interlocutors, whereas streaming 

agents intervene more directly in our chain of thought. However, little is known about how these 

different types of LLMs affect cognition. In particular, can an LLM influence, or even alter, the 

thinking of the human it assists?
